Website Construction
Part 1, Oct 2, 2019
Welcome to the new landing page for Engineer.tf!
Our website is currently under construction and will hopefully be done soon! Until then, you can check 
out the resources on the right side bar for our youtube, twitch, and discord information. Our discord is 
full of other engineer mains and other highlander players who are highly experianced in playing the format 
and are always willing to help out or answer questions. Feel free to drop in and say hello!

Welcome to Engineer.tf!
Built by Engineers, for Engineers; Oct 2, 2019
Engineer.tf is a competitive engineering resource for the game Team Fortress 2.
It was created in december 2016 by Mothership, waxx, and Exa_ to foster growth of engineer mains. 
We provide map reviews, demo reviews, mentoring, and discussion from the standpoint of high level game-play 
to ensure that the next generation of engineers will be ready to be the best they can be.
